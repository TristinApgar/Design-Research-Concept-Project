                    <p>This example is able to represent what we want when creating a website that has the "F" design pattern in mind.</p>
                    <p>The top left is usually where a user will look first, so it's best to put a company/website logo at the top left.</p>
                    <p>Then, for the top bar of an "F", you would want to put something like a navbar, or search bar. This is because it allows the user to easily navigate across your website without putting much effort into it. Say if you were to put the navbar at the bottom of a webpage, it would be a lot harder for the user to find it.</p>
                    <p>For the stem of an "F", you could possibly put a navbar there instead. If you want to have a search bar, and a navbar, then it could be a good idea to put the navbar on the left side of the screen. You do not have to put a navbar on the left, but it could be the best option since that's where a majority of users will look.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col textNextTo">
                            <p>It's also good to put images on the right side of the screen, unless you want the user to view the image instead of the text next to it. If you have an image first, it is less likely the text to the right of the image would've been read.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col">
                            <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f684f16b0ef0820c73749eb/1601742134409-Z7ALNC15IO03AIUNHWS5/1_oFKmittepaRKz3957Hsxfg.jpeg?format=750w" class="exampleImg">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>To sum all of this up, in "F" shape design pattern you would: Have a logo in the top left corner of the website screen, Put a navbar either at the top of the website to fit in the top bar of an "F", or put the navbar on the left side of the website to fit the stem of an "F", you would lay your text that you have on your website going from left to right across the page to fit the bars of an "F", and put images on the right side of text unless the images are a larger priority in your website.</p>
