            <p>A good way to get an understanding the "F" design pattern of websites is by looking at some good examples of websites accounting for this design pattern. Under this text there should be links and descriptions to websites.</p>
            <h2>Good Examples:</h2>
        </div>
        
        <br>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Ohio Means Jobs</h3>
            <h6>Link to Ohio Means Jobs: <a href="https://ohiomeansjobs.ohio.gov/home">https://ohiomeansjobs.ohio.gov/home</a></h6>
            <p>Ohio Means jobs is a good example because the webpage is structured in rows going from left to right, while having the more important parts of the webpage on the left, like the search bar or the headers for the different rows.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Google Drive</h3>
            <h6>Link to Google Drive: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive">https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive</a></h6>
            <p>The main google drive page when opening your drive is a great example for the "F" design pattern, this is because the most important parts of the webpage account for the "F" design pattern area. Notice how the navigation bar is on the far left, which is accounting for the stem of a "F" area. The suggested or most recent slides are on the top of the webpage all in a row, which is accounting for the top bar of the "F" area.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>YouTube</h3>
            <h6>Link to YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">https://www.youtube.com/</a></h6>
            <p>YouTube is another great example of the "F" design pattern. First, the YouTube logo is in the top left, allowing for easy visibilty as well as an easy way to navigate to the home page since it can be one of the first things a user will see. Next, the navbar is on the left and it is in the stem of the "F" design area, allowing user's to find a good way to navigate the website. Next, the videos that show up in rows are perfect in the "F" design area bars, so the links to videos are very accessible to users. Lastly, the search bar is in the top bar of the "F" design area, so users will be able to know where to look if they want to search for specific videos or content.</p>

            <h2>Bad example:</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>The SpaceJam website</h3>
            <h6>Link to the spacejam website: <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/">https://www.spacejam.com/1996/</a></h6>
            <p>The 1996 Space Jam website is a bad example of the "F" design pattern, specifically the home page is not a good example. Basically, nothing in the home page is in the "F" design pattern, all of the links and even the logo make up a circle, with the logo in the middle, which makes it a little harder for the user to navigate the website. Now the other pages of the website are a bit better, they have the logo in the top left, and the navbar for other pages is on left side of the webpage, but that really all it has going for it. The whole website is fairly hard to navigate, but I will admit it has a lot of charm to it, the web designers were more focused on charm rather than accessibilty, whether or not that is a good or bad idea is up to you.</p>
